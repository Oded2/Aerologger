[Website](https://aerologger.netlify.app)

This is a project is made from my passion of aviation. It's a SvelteKit developed web application, allowing for easy flight logging. It's worth noting that this project is always being updated. 

## Prerequisites

- Node.js

## Usage

To use AeroLogger, simply create an account or login, go to the new flight  page, and simply log your flight. You can then view your notebook, view other people's profiles, and more.

## Privacy

*Please do not share any personal information with AeroLogger.* Each log has the ability to be public or private. Please note that while the database is protected, logs are not encrypted inside the database.

*Publicity Status*
- Public - Anyone can view your log either from your profile, or with the log Id.
- Private - Only you can view your log.

Publicity status can be changed at any time, as well as being able to make all flights in the logbook public or private at one time.

## Development

AeroLogger is developed using many different apps and libraries. To mention a few: 
* SvelteKit
* Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap Javascript
* Supabase
* Font Awesome
